# vision-robot-arm

Continuation of the [Vision-Robot-Arm Project:](https://github.com/LIMUNQUE/vision-robot-arm/tree/master) The purpose of this project is to create a pick-and-place color classifier using artificial vision with OpenCV. This robotic arm (ARM) was developed in ROS Noetic as the final assignment for the Serial and Mobile Robots course. Weâ€™ve chosen the KUKA KR3 model design for lightweight tasks.

For a quick test, you can use the following instructions:

```sh
roslaunch kr3_gazebo kr3_gazebo.launch gripper_2f:=true camera:=true
```
```sh
roslaunch kuka_arm_2f_moveit move_group.launch
```
```sh
rosrun camera_processing image_processor.py
```
```sh
rosrun kr3_master traj_coor.py
```
